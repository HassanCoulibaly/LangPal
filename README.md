The prototype's design is based on Duolingo-like interface, using a simple green color scheme like them to best fit the requirements of this assignment. Navigation is centered around a BottomNavigationBar to clearly separate the app's main sections (Home, Messages, Profile). The LangPal logo is featured in the AppBar, centered for focus on the brand.

Technically, I built the app with Flutter for rapid, cross-platform development. I chose the provider package for simple state management, specifically to handle the light/dark mode theme toggle across the entire application. The structure is modular, with each screen (Home, Profile, Partner List) separated into its own widget file to keep the code organized and easy to maintain. Finally, I used the flutter_launcher_icons package to automate the generation of app icons from a single source image, streamlining the build process.
